This documentation describes Datadog Cluster Monitoring for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Datadog Cluster Monitoring combines our Datadog Nozzle with the Datadog Agent, and enables PCF users and administrators to monitor the health and performance of their PCF clusters.

For comprehensive monitoring, you can also install the [BOSH Health Monitor](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloud_foundry/#configure-the-datadog-plugin-for-bosh-health-monitor).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Datadog Cluster Monitoring for PCF is made up of two components:
* The Datadog Firehose Nozzle
* The Datadog Agent

The Datadog Nozzle is a Cloud Foundry component which forwards metrics from the Loggregator Firehose to the Datadog monitoring platform. Any Cloud Foundry deployment can send metrics and events to Datadog. The data helps you track the health and availability of all nodes in the deployment, monitor the jobs they run, collect metrics from the Loggregator Firehose, and more.

The Datadog Agent is small daemon that is installed via BOSH addon to run on every host and collect infrastructure metrics from each host.

Datadog Cluster Monitoring for PCF includes the following key features:

* Visualization of all cluster level operational metrics and KPIs
* Alerting on PCF cluster and component health
* Monitoring of jobs
* Tracking and reporting of BOSH events

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform for cloud-scale infrastructure and applications.
Datadog provides full-stack observability by combining infrastructure metrics and events with
application performance metrics and end-to-end tracing. With flexible graphs and dashboards,
sophisticated alerting, and machine learning functionality for anomaly and outlier detection,
the platform provides actionable insight into dynamic, modern environments. Datadog features
200+ vendor-supported integrations, with simple configuration and built-in template dashboards.

Additional details about the Datadog integration with Cloud Foundry are avaialble via [Datadog's documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloud_foundry/).
