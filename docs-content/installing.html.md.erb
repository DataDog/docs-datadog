This topic describes how to install and configure Datadog Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

1. Ensure you have installed the [Datadog Agent BOSH Release](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloud_foundry/#install-the-datadog-agent-bosh-release)
   and [BOSH Health Monitor](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloud_foundry/#configure-the-datadog-plugin-for-bosh-health-monitor).

1. Download the product file for the **Datadog Nozzle for PCF** from Pivotal Network.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of **Datadog Nozzle for PCF**.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **Datadog Nozzle for PCF** title.

1. In the **Datadog Config** section enter your [Datadog API key](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api). Leave the Metrics Prefix and Datadog API URL as is unless directed otherwise by [Datadog Support](https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/).

1. Create a UAA client account for Datadog using the [UAA CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/uaa/uaa-user-management.html). The Nozzle will require access to the Loggregator Firehose.
